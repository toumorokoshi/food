    * bring 3 cups of grape juice to a boil
    * put three TABLESPOONS of agar powder/flakes, or appropriate equivalence, into the pot
    * make sure the agar is completely dissolved, then turn off the heat
* Let the agar grape juice cool *very* briefly, then pour into the

* When serving, cut it out of the terrine and flip it upside down for maximal effect
